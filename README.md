The number of customers has grown – Most people will choose to go to a business that accepts electronic payments over one that doesn’t, if they have a choice between them. Many young people don’t know how to write a paper check and don’t have a checking account.

Savings in both time and labor – Making and mailing invoices and processing paper-based (check) payments takes a lot of time and effort, as does making and mailing checks. When customers can’t find their original bill because they misplaced it or it was lost in the mail, the company has to make and send out a new one.
